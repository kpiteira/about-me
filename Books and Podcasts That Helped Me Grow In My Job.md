# Books & Podcasts That Helped Me Grow In My Job

Work in progress, only books for now

## Work & Management

1. [Radical Candor](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29939161-radical-candor): My absolute favorite. Mostly management oriented but makes sense to everyone who strongly believes that growth mindset is critical to a flourishing organization, and that people doing are the best placed to make most decisions.
2. [Measure What Matters](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39286958-measure-what-matters): The Book on OKRs
3. [The Five Dysfunctions of a Team](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21343.The_Five_Dysfunctions_of_a_Team): Touches on many topics with a pleasent narrative
4. [The Fearless Organization](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40275161-the-fearless-organization): While I was not super impressed by the book, this is such a critical topic that it is a must read. What I didn't like is probably that I had the wrong expectations: I already knew about the importance of psychological safety, and what the lack of it can do to an organization, so I was expecting more actionnable ways to make an org psychologically safe. But it didn't really answer my expectation hence my average rating of the book. But again, still a must-read!
5. [The Customer-Driven Playbook](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33584559-the-customer-driven-playbook)
6. [Hit Refresh](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30835567-hit-refresh): Microsoft's culture and its values, and how Satya Nadella changed it
7. [Blitzscaling](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39037161-blitzscaling): Summary in 1 sentence: focus on what will kill you first :)
8. [Trillion Dollar Coach](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42118073-trillion-dollar-coach): A really fascinating story about Bill Campbell who coached many execs from companies like Google or Apple.
9. [Skin in the Game](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36064445-skin-in-the-game): While not strictly speaking a work/management book, it is a great book about accountability IMO, one of the core values at MS. Builds on Anti-fragile and The black swan from the same author.
10. [The Infinite Game](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38597764-the-infinite-game): A great pitch for long term vs short term.
11. [The Phoenix Project](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17255186-the-phoenix-project): good fiction book about DevOps. To read or listen

## Health

1. [Why We Sleep](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36294636-why-we-sleep): Sleep is the most important thing we can do for our health and hence our performance at work
